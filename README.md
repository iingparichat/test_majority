# Problem Description

Majority element of an array is defined as a value x for which strictly more than half of array elements are equal to x.
Output the majority element of the given array a, or -1 if the array doesn't have majority element.
â€‹
The first line of the input contains an integer N - the number of elements in the array. 1 <= N <= 100.
The second line of the input contains N integers - the elements of the array, separated with single spaces. 1 <= ai <= 100.

## How to run
```
python majority.py N 'N intgers'
Example:
python majority.py 5 '8 8 2 4 8'
